# Project and Workspace Manager for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

## About this fork

Randy3k's original plugin only manages project files, but not workspaces.
I wanted to be able to use the workspace functionality of sublime text, as I find it really useful, so I modified the plugin in consequence.
Compared to the initial plugin, this fork add the following options:
- Create a new workspace
- Open an existing workspace (in current or new window)
- Rename a workspace

In addition, I made a few other modifications such as:
- Display the current project/workspace name in the status bar
- Possibility to group several projects by theme in subfolders
- Additional options to choose the behavior of sublime when opening a project
- Add a few safeguards to prevent errors and data loss when manipulating projects

This fork can be installed via Package Control by adding this repository in Sublime Text in this way:
- If `ProjectManager` is already installed, remove it using `Package Control: Remove Package`
- In the Command Palette, choose `Package Control: Add Repository`
- Enter the path to this Github page, i.e. https://github.com/Valentin-Guillet/ProjectManager
- Follow the same instructions as for the original plugin, described below

To revert back to the original package, simply uninstall `ProjectManager`, remove this repository via `Package Control: Remove Repository` and reinstall `ProjectManager` (the standard version will be selected).


-------------------------------

## Original Plugin

Don't have any idea what `*.sublime-project` and `*.sublime-workspace` are doing? Forget where the project files are? Don't worry, Project Manager will help organizing the project files by putting them in a centralized location. (It is inspired by Atom's [Project Manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager), but Atom's Project Manager is inspired by the built-in Sublime Text Project Manager, so there is a circular reasoning here).

## Installation

Using **Package Control** is not required, but recommended as it keeps your packages (with their dependencies) up-to-date!

### Installation via Package Control

* [Install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st3)
  * Close and reopen Sublime Text after having installed Package Control.
* Open the Command Palette (`Tools > Command Palette`).
* Choose `Package Control: Install Package`.
* Search for [`ProjectManager` on Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ProjectManager) and select to install.

## Usage

To launch ProjectManager, use the main menu (`Project > Project Manager`) or the command palette (`Project Manager: ...`).

To quickly switch between projects, use the hotkey <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> on macOS (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> on Windows / Linux).

ProjectManager also improves the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>W</kbd> on Windows / Linux so that it will close the project when the window is closed. On OSX, this is the default behaviour.

Options are self-explanatory, enjoy!

### Create new project

Just drag some folders to Sublime Text and then "Add Project". The project files will be created in `Packages/User/Projects/`.

### Add existing projects to Project Manager

There are two ways to add existing projects to Project Manager.

- If you want Project Manager manages the project files: move your `*.sublime-
  project` and `*.sublime-workspace` files in the project directory
  `Packages/User/Projects/`. You may need to update the project's folder
  information of the files. Don't forget to run `Project Manager: Refresh Projects` after it.

- If you want to keep the project files (`*.sublime-project` and `*.sublime-workspace`) in your
  project directory: open your project file `*.sublime-project`, and then use the import option of
  Project Manager. This tells Project Manager where `*.sublime-project` is located and Project
  Manager will know where to look when the project is opened. In other words, you can put the
  `*.sublime-project` file in any places.



### FAQ

- _How to open project in a new window with a shortcut?_
It can be done by adding the following keybind in your user keybind settings file:

```
{
    "keys": ["super+ctrl+o"], // or ["ctrl+alt+o"] for Windows/Linux
    "command": "project_manager", "args": {"action": "open_project_in_new_window"}
}
```
